This project is designed to prepare you for delivering a polished, end-to-end solution report of a real-world problem in a field of interest. When developing new technology, or deriving adaptations of previous technology, properly documenting your process is critical for both validating and replicating your results.

The project consists of three different files:
  - capstone_exploration.ipynb
  - capstone_benchmark.ipynb
  - capstone_project.ipynb

## Capstone Exploration
In this section, the dataset will be analyzed to understand how each feature is related to the others, consider the importance of each feature and find out which are actually relevant for understanding the price of the product. Then the data will preprocess to create a better representation of price by performing a scaling and detecting (and removing if needed) outliers to obtain significant and meaningful results and get the prices related to the best sellers. 

## Capstone Benchmark
Benchmarking is the process of comparing the result to an existing method or running a very simple machine learning model to get baseline in performance. A baseline in performance gives an idea of how well all other models will actually perform on the problem.
For this project, two benchmark models were selected. First a Persistence model will be used as a really simple and fast benchmark model. Then, a second and more advance Xgboost model will be used to get a better idea of the performance using all the features avaiable.

## Capstone Project
Brand manufacturers should constantly look to evaluate their pricing, learn what works, and make improvements. If the price is too low, you run the risk of not being able to obtain a healthy profit. On the other hand, if the price is too high and you run the risk of not making any sale. Optimal pricing is as much art as it is science, and it can mean the difference between an avalanche of orders flowing out or a mountain of excess stock sitting somewhere. Pricing products and services online is one of the most exciting and complex exercises and, as an online business, finding the right formula is one of the most important questions to solve

For this project a dataset of historical sells of an e-commerce site will be used to develop an algorithm to predict the optimal competitive price for a new product to be published. The algorithm needs to determine what is the relevant data in order to get the best prediction for the price taking into account seasonal prices, market fluctuations, economic trends, better sellers, etc.
